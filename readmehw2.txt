To implement hw2.c:

All commands will execute when run. (Part 1)

Part 2 (History Feature):

Do not try executing !(number) as a command or a statement with '&'. This has not been implemented. 

**Depending on what terminal platform is used, greater than 10 commands may not show up properly.** The add() function to add an element has been tested and works properly though.

To run: gcc <filename>
./a.out
